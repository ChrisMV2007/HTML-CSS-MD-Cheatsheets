                <p>Semantic; provide meaning (generally stuff that helps with page naviagtion for both bots and people). Also important for acessibility to screen readers and assisitive technology. <br>
                Semantics usually do not show up on the website, just provide meaning to the code <br>
                Semantics includes the header, footer, navigation, and more. <br>
                Sections and articles are also semantics.</p>

                    <p>The div tag is almost identical to the section tag (both can be styled in CSS and define a section of code), but the div 
                        tag does not carry any semantic meaning when first created (all of it's meaning is deived from how it is styled in CSS).</p>
                </div>
